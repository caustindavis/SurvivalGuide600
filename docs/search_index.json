Austin Davis 2022-09-15 Preface There are hundreds of R guides available online. This is the only one written specifically for students in SIS600 at American University. It introduces the basics of R for data analysis for graduate students with no prior experience in R or statistical computing more broadly. While it will not answer all of your questions about R, we hope you will find it a useful companion to lectures, assignments, and other course materials. We regularly update this guide.
