[["frequency-and-cross-tabulation.html", "Chapter 6 Frequency and cross tabulation", " Chapter 6 Frequency and cross tabulation Nominal data require a different approach. Rather than summary statistics, the relevant information here is the frequency with which each value or category appears in the data. Here we cover how to analyze data for a single nominal variable (e.g. frequency tables and bar charts) and how to evaluate relationships between nominal variables (cross-tabulation). Note that you will need the film data (biopics.xls) to replicate the examples in this chapter.

The first step is to create a basic cross-tabulation of the joint frequency using the count() function. Here we consider the possibility that the representation of female subjects in biopics (SubjectSex) has changed over time (Period). # Raw cross-tabulation xtab = film %&gt;% count(SubjectSex,Period) %&gt;% # (OutcomeVar,ExposureVar) na.omit() %&gt;% # drop NA categories # now organize results into a 2-way table pivot_wider( names_from = Period, # MUST be the ExposureVar values_from = n, values_fill = 0 ) xtab ## # A tibble: 2 × 4 ## SubjectSex `1915--1965` `1965--1999` `2000--2014` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Female 44 59 74 ## 2 Male 132 203 249 Second, use chisq.test() to conduct a \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence. Specify the contingency table created above and add [-1] to exclude the first column (category names) from the calculation/ chisq.test(xtab[-1]) ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: xtab[-1] ## X-squared = 0.40125, df = 2, p-value = 0.8182 Based on these results, the given sex of biopic subjects is independent of (ie does not differ systematically across) time period. The relationship is not statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2(2,N=761)=0.40\\), \\(p=0.81\\)). Finally, to present the results of a cross-tabulation, convert the raw frequencies in your table to percentages (within categories of the the exposure variable). Start by calling the raw tabulation from above. # Relative freq for presentations xtab %&gt;% # add a row total mutate(Total = rowSums(.[-1])) %&gt;% # convert to percentage mutate_at(-1, ~ round(100 * ./sum(.), digits=1)) ## # A tibble: 2 × 5 ## SubjectSex `1915--1965` `1965--1999` `2000--2014` Total ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Female 25 22.5 22.9 23.3 ## 2 Male 75 77.5 77.1 76.7 Copy and paste the table into your document. Then format appropriately (e.g. category labels) for final presentation. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
